# üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíº Sales-Insights-Analysis
Analyzing sales data for a company to identify gaps in their revenue and help their sales managers curate effective strategies to target customers and improve profit.

## üìà Problem Statement
- The company **Atliq** had trouble tracking their sales and coming up with a complete picture of what's happening with their revenue, profit and customer base.
- Atliq wants to have a dashboard that can automate this manual data gathering process and help them make data driven decisions.
- Additionally, it also wants to leverage the dashbaord to conduct a profit analysis of their customers, understand gaps in revenue and sales in their markets.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Main Objective
- The main business objective of this analysis is to uncover insights to find a way to improve the company's sales and identify their best customers.

## ‚è≥ Process Flow
My focus would be on 2020 sepcifically to understand the change in sales and revenue throughout the year.
- I have analyzed and divided the data into three different sections 
   - General Insights - Where I talk about things I observe high level.
   - Profit Analysis - Where I delve deeper into the data and get a sense of how markets and csutomers are contributing to the company's revenue and sales.
   - Performance Insights - Understand how revenue is performing over time and by zone. In addition to that, I drill down to each customer and understand how every bracket of my customer base is performing.

## üî® General Insights

- Looking at the first sheet, Delhi tops the charts with being the highest contributor to Revenue and Sales.
- The drop in Revenue over time is most likely due to impact of the pandemic.
- The company has generated 142M in Revenue and sold 350k in product quantities.
- Lastly I've curated a list of the top 5 customers **Atliq** has in terms of Revenue.
- Majority of these customers who bring the most revenue are brick and mortar stores which make sense.

## üí∞ Profit Analysis

- Despite Delhi being the greatest contributer of revenue, it is better to look at profit contribution as a measure of a city's profitability.
- Looking at which city contributes the most to **Atliq's** profit, Mumbai comes out on top.
- Even though Mumbai does not contribte as much to revenue as Delhi, it brings the most profit which is something **Atliq** would be inerested in.
- Based on Profit Margin %, Bhubhaneshwar draws the highest profit margin which translates to getting a high ROI for every Rupee spent. For every 100 Rs spent, the company in Bhubhaneshwar made 10.5 Rs in profit.
- Ideally Revenue should be proportional to Profit margin which leads to evaluating the kind of strategies and promotions being used in Delhi for its unproportionate contribution.

### üè¨ Looking at customers who bring in the most profit

- Ordering the customer base by Revenue, we look at **Electricalsbea Stores** which has an interesting situation.
- Even though the store does not give you a high Profit Margin %, it does churn a lot of Revenue which implies that the store buys a lot of products from **Atliq**.

- Similarly, **Atliq** should think about how they want to approach the customers that do not bring in a lot of revenue.

## üï¥üèæ Performance Insights

- Among all zones, the South zone brings in the most profit for the company.
- The company can also see that Revenue has dropped by month vs Last year with the profit margin % decreasing as well.
- The total profit margin as of 2020 is 2.1M Rs

## Recommendations
- Employ promotion and discounts to customers who bring the most revenue to the company so they buy more products from **Atliq**.
- With Mumbai's profit contribution being the highest, look at what strategies are being used in Mumbai and translate it into other cities to imrove profit.
- Bhubhaneshwar should be injected with more business as it's already churning profit with minimal investment in product quantities. With more discounts would lead to purchase of product quantities, leading to maximizing the ROI the city provides.
- Promotion Strategies should be directed at **Electricalsbea Stores** to encourage the store to keep buying products from **Atliq**.
- Plan a exit strategy for customers who are brining in the lowerst revenue for the organization.
- Work on product quality, promotions and advertising to improve sales and profit in the **North** and **Central** regions.
