# üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíº Sales-Insights-Analysis
Analyzing sales data for a company to identify gaps in their revenue and help their sales managers curate effective strategies to target customers and improve profit.

## üìà Problem Statement
- The company **Atliq** had trouble tracking their sales and coming up with a complete picture of what's happening with their revenue, profit and customer base.
- Atliq wants to have a dashboard that can automate this manual data gathering process and help them make data driven decisions.
- Additionally, it also wants to leverage the dashbaord to conduct a profit analysis of their customers, understand gaps in revenue and sales in their markets.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Main Objective
- The main business objective of this analysis is to uncover insights to find a way to improve the company's sales and identify their best customers.

## ‚è≥ Process Flow
My focus would be on 2020 sepcifically to understand the change in sales and revenue throughout the year.
- I have analyzed and divided the data into three different sections 
   - General Insights - Where I talk about things I observe high level.
   - Profit Analysis - Where I delve deeper into the data and get a sense of how markets and csutomers are contributing to the company's revenue and sales.
   - Performance Insights - Understand how revenue is performing over time and by zone. In addition to that, I drill down to each customer and understand how every bracket of my customer base is performing.

## General Insights

- Looking at the first sheet, Delhi tops the charts with being the highest contributor to Revenue and Sales.
- The drop in Revenue over time is most likely due to impact of the pandemic.
- The company has generated 142M in Revenue and sold 350k in product quantities.
- Lastly I've curated a list of the top 5 customers **Atliq** has in terms of Revenue.
- Majority of these customers who bring the most revenue are brick and mortar stores which make sense.

## Profit Analysis

- Despite Delhi being the greatest contributer of revenue, it is better to look at profit contribution as a measure of a city's profitability.
- Looking at which city contributes the most to **Atliq's** profit, Mumbai comes out on top.
- Even though Mumbai does not contribte as much to revenue as Delhi, it brings the most profit which is something **Atliq** would be inerested in.
- Based on Profit Margin %, Bhubhaneshwar draws the highest profit margin which translates to getting a high ROI for every Rupee spent. For every 100 Rs spent, the company in Bhubhaneshwar made 10.5 Rs in profit.
- Ideally Revenue should be proportional to Profit margin which leads to evaluating the kind of strategies and promotions being used in Delhi for its unproportionate contribution.

### Looking at customers who bring in the most profit

- Ordering the customer base by Revenue, we look at **Electricalsbea Stores** which has an interesting situation.
- Even though the store does not give you a high Profit Margin %, it does churn a lot of Revenue which implies that the store buys a lot of products from **Atliq**.

- Similarly, **Atliq** should think about how they want to approach the customers that do not bring in a lot of revenue.
